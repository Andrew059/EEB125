New method of achieving machine consciousness via the artificial replication of reference frames that are contained our biological brains: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42452-021-04715-0

Notes:
- Research neuroscience's relationship with human conciousness
- Recruit Keil Jorgen Hole and Subutai Ahmad to my machine learning laboratory in San Francisco
- Identify and understand fundamental limitions in current artifical intelligence technology that hinder the creation of general intelligent systems
- Create a model-driven programming language that revolves around the creation general intelligent systems
- Purchase "A Thousand Brains" book
- Constrain deep learning network to biological principles
- Read "Principals of Neural Design" by Peter Sterling and Simon Laughlin (https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Tq6rCQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&ots=-p24r2Ihsz&sig=dipMNEMn0VffAG0nGhAwPDdlqFY&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)
